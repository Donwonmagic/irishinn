                    <h3>The Fire & The Phoenix</h3>
                    <p>The story begins with a spark. In 1930, the Moxley family home—which stood on this very ground—burned to the ground. Undeterred, the family rebuilt the structure in 1931 as a tavern to celebrate the end of Prohibition.</p>
                    <p>It was a simple roadside stop for travelers heading up MacArthur Boulevard, offering cold beer and a view of the Potomac.</p>

                    <p>In 1944, Otto Kumfert purchased the tavern and renamed it <strong>Otto’s Grill</strong>. It became a local institution, known for its hearty food and no-nonsense atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>By the 1960s, it had transformed into <strong>Trav’s</strong>, a notorious roadhouse and biker bar. Legend has it that the bar fights were as legendary as the chili, and the "wild west" spirit of Glen Echo was alive and well within these walls.</p>

                    <p>The rough edges were sanded down in the late 80s when it became <strong>The Inn at Glen Echo</strong>. The motorcycles were traded for sedans, and the menu shifted toward fine dining.</p>
                    <p>However, the building still held its secrets. Staff began reporting strange occurrences—footsteps in empty rooms, lights flickering, and the feeling of being watched.</p>

            <p class="ghost-text">
                The Inn is widely considered one of the most haunted locations in Maryland. 
                Guests and staff alike have reported seeing a "Lady in White" wandering the upstairs dining rooms. 
                Others tell tales of a mischievous spirit at the bar who likes to reorganize the glassware when no one is looking. 
                Don't worry—they seem to be friendly spirits, perhaps just enjoying one last pint.

                    <p>In 2003, Christy Hughes, a native of County Galway and former manager of The Dubliner in D.C., saw the potential in the historic building. Along with his wife Libby, he purchased the property and began a massive renovation.</p>
                    <p>They peeled back the layers of history to reveal the original wood, added the beautiful oak bar you see today, and reopened as <strong>The Irish Inn at Glen Echo</strong>.</p>
